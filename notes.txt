TGFS data
=========

route_id is eg "B43"


Getting all the stop IDs for each route
---------------------------------------

We can get ``route_id``s from routes.txt (or trips.txt if we deduplicate)

We want ``stop_id``s.

1.	read ``route_id``s from routes.txt

2.	``route_id`` to many ``trip_id`` via trips.txt

3.	``trip_id`` to many ``stop_id`` via stop_times.txt

Stops have sequence numbers within a givin trip.


Getting other potentially useful data
-------------------------------------

Stop lan/lon and name from stops.txt by ``stop_id``

Shape for route: get trip ids, and find shape for each trip in trip.txt
